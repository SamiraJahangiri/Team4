## Objectives

The goal of our project is to address vaccine and resource distribution and disparities as well as vaccine hesitancy by providing the public with pertinent and easily accessible data on COVID-19 cases and risk factors/vulnerability indices, as well as social media-derived sentiment analysis. With this data, we will enable the public  make informed decisions to keep themselves and their communities safe since disease spread is largely predicated on social behavior.
